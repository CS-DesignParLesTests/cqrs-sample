# Cqrs sample project
The goal of the project is to build a RESTful API with NestJs  and make it use Command Query Responsibility Segregation ‚Äì CQRS.
For the development of this REST-API we will use the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

The theme of our API is "lockdown friendly üò∑" a "click and collect", reserve a time slot to to go to the hairdresser üíá like "https://reservations.jeanlouisdavid.com/reservation/salon"
