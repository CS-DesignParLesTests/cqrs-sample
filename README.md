# Proposal features roadmap
The goal of the project is to build a RESTful API with NestJs  and make it use Command Query Responsibility Segregation – CQRS.
For the development of this REST-API we will use the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

The theme of our API is "lockdown friendly 😷" a "click and collect", reserve a time slot to pick up a sold item.

# REST API 🛣️
The REST API is described below.
